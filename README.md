# Job Post Analysis Dashboard  

## Overview  
This project was developed as part of my Data Analyst Internship at NullClass. It focuses on building an **Interactive Job Post Analysis Dashboard** using Tableau. The dashboard visualizes job post data from various websites with dynamic filters and custom criteria, providing actionable insights into job market trends. The final dashboard is hosted on Netlify for easy accessibility.  

## Features  
- Interactive visualizations using Tableau.  
- Dynamic filters based on specific criteria like job type, company size, and geography.  
- Time-sensitive chart display functionality.  
- Integration of latitude and longitude for geographical mapping.  

## Project Tasks  
1. **Task 1:** Visualize job posts based on gender preferences, job types, and company names starting with specific letters.  
2. **Task 2:** Filter data for African continent jobs, display time-restricted charts, and include interactive mapping using latitude and longitude.  
3. **Task 3:** Analyze job posts with constraints on salary, experience, and other criteria for the Asian continent.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Python:** Data preprocessing and filtering large datasets.  
- **Tableau:** Creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.  
- **Netlify:** Hosting the final dashboard for public access.  

## Challenges and Solutions  
- Preprocessing large datasets using Python to overcome Excel and SQL limitations.  
- Filtering data for continents using latitude and longitude ranges.  
- Handling range fields (e.g., salary, experience) by deriving numerical values.  
- Implementing time-restricted chart displays using Tableau calculated fields.  

## Final Deliverables  
- **Interactive Dashboard:** [Visit the Dashboard](https://jobpostanalysisdashboard.netlify.app/)  
- **GitHub Repository:** Contains the data preprocessing scripts, Tableau workbook, and hosting details.
- **Kaggle link:** Refer this link for the dataset [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravindrasinghrana/job-description-dataset)
